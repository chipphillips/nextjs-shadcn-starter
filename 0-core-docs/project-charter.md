# Project Charter - Constructiv AI Web Application

## About This Project

This project charter defines the development of an AI-powered web application designed to streamline back-office workflows and increase efficiency for small to midsize construction businesses. The platform will leverage advanced technology to simplify complex construction processes while ensuring accessibility and usability for construction professionals.

**When to Reference:**

- During development team onboarding
- When making architectural decisions
- During sprint planning and feature prioritization
- When evaluating project progress

**How to Use:**

1. Refer to this charter for overall project direction
2. Use as basis for feature prioritization
3. Align technical decisions with stated goals
4. Update as project evolves with stakeholder input

**Key Considerations:**

- Focus on construction industry-specific needs
- Prioritize mobile and offline capabilities
- Ensure AI integration adds practical value
- Maintain simplicity and usability

- **Construction Management Software**

- Software  should be an enabler. It should NOT hinder you. It should NOT restrict you.
- Software should do things that **only it can do**, to **enable you to do things that only you can and should be doing.**

- **Qualities Of A Good Construction Management Software**

- construction management software is only useful if it is fast, addictive, and useful to the application.
- If it if it creates complexity, it's not worth the users time. If it adds a number of different steps, it is wasting the users time.
- It should make normal and necessary workflows faster.
- It should **streamline** and **automate** natural processes like, for example, RFIs, submittals, daily reports, documentation, scheduling and pay applications.
- The software needs to adapt to the users workflow—they need to be able to configure the application to work their way.
- The software must increase efficiency.
- The software should enhance communication, focus, and teamwork.
