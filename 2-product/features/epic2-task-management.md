# Epic 2: Task Management

1. **Feature Name**
   - **Task Management**

2. **Purpose & Value**
   - Allows users to organize construction activities effectively by breaking them down into manageable tasks.
   - Solves the challenge of keeping teams aligned and on track, improving accountability and overall productivity.

3. **User Story**
   > As a site supervisor, I want to create and assign tasks to my team, so that everyone knows their responsibilities and deadlines.
   > As a project manager, I want to create reusable process templates from groups of tasks, so I can standardize and streamline common construction workflows.

4. **Key Actions & User Flow**
   1. **Create a task** with a title, description, and category (e.g., pre-construction, administrative).
   2. **Assign tasks** to team members and set due dates and priorities.
   3. **View tasks** in different formats (Kanban, calendar, list).
   4. **Update task statuses** (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed).
   5. **Receive notifications** on task updates or upcoming deadlines.
   6. **Create and manage processes** by grouping related tasks together
   7. **Save processes as templates** for reuse across projects
   8. **Apply process templates** when starting new projects

5. **Acceptance Criteria**
   - **Sub-feature 2.1: Task Creation and Organization**
     - Users can create tasks with a minimum of a title and description.
     - Tasks can be categorized (e.g., pre-construction, construction, administrative).
     - Users can attach at least one document or reference to a task.
     - Subtasks and checklists can be created and linked to parent tasks.
     - Tasks must validate and save only if required fields (title, due date) are complete.

   - **Sub-feature 2.2: Task Assignment and Tracking**
     - Tasks can be assigned to team members with a specified due date.
     - Users can set priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Urgent) for each task.
     - Users can track task completion percentages in real-time.
     - Dependencies between tasks are visible, and warnings appear for incomplete prerequisites.
     - Team members receive notifications when a task is assigned to them.

   - **Sub-feature 2.3: Task Views (Kanban, Calendar, List)**
     - Users can toggle between Kanban, list, and calendar views.
     - Tasks in Kanban view are draggable between statuses.
     - Calendar view displays tasks with due dates on the corresponding day.
     - Users can filter tasks by priority, status, or category.
     - Updates in one view reflect across all views.

   - **Sub-feature 2.4: Process Management**
     - Users can create a process by selecting and grouping multiple tasks
     - Users can name and describe processes for future reference
     - Users can specify process metadata:
       - Phase (e.g., Foundation, Framing)
       - Estimated duration in days
       - Category alignment with tasks
     - Users can save processes as templates for reuse
     - Users can view all saved processes in a dedicated process library
     - Users can apply existing process templates to new projects:
       - Due dates automatically calculated based on process duration
       - Tasks distributed evenly across the timeline
       - Original task relationships maintained
     - Process templates track usage statistics:
       - Number of times used
       - Projects using the template
       - Last usage date
     - Basic version control for templates
     - Users can filter processes by:
       - Category
       - Phase
       - Usage frequency
       - Recent activity

9. **Open Questions**
   - Should tasks support **multiple assignees** or only a single owner?
     - Task can have multiple assignees.
   - Is **time tracking** (e.g., hours spent) required at this stage, or in a later phase?
     - Yes, we will need to track time spent on tasks. But it should be made available to the user as a report.
   - Will tasks be **exportable** or sharable outside the platform (e.g., CSV, PDF)?
     - Yes, we will need to export tasks to CSV and PDF and components can be shared as a link.
   - Should processes support **conditional tasks** that depend on project attributes?
     - Yes, we will need to support conditional tasks that depend on project attributes.
   - How should we handle **process template updates** for projects already using an older version?
     - We should allow for partial application of process templates.
   - Should we allow **partial application** of process templates?
     - Yes, we should allow for partial application of process templates.
