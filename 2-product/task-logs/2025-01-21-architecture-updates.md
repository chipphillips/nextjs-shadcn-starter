# Architecture Documentation Updates - January 21, 2025

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Backend Architecture Documentation
- Enhanced `architecture.md` with comprehensive system documentation
- Added detailed sections for:
  - API Layer structure
  - Database schema definitions
  - Service layer organization
  - Task management flows
  - Data flows for AI features
  - Performance optimizations
  - Security measures
  - Monitoring & logging
  - Development guidelines
  - Deployment strategy
  - Integration points

### 2. API Documentation Structure
- Created organized documentation structure in `/docs/6-backend/api/`
- Mapped implementation paths to documentation
- Added implementation checklists for routes and services
- Documented error handling standards and authentication patterns

### 3. Data Models Integration
- Connected `/docs/4-models/` with implementation patterns
- Created clear mapping between:
  - Data models → Database schema
  - Enums → Constants
  - Interfaces → Route types
- Added type safety guidelines for:
  - Database layer
  - API layer
  - Service layer
- Documented model validation rules and relationships

## Next Steps

1. **Implementation Tasks**
   - [ ] Generate Supabase types from schema
   - [ ] Create initial route handlers
   - [ ] Set up service layer classes
   - [ ] Implement validation schemas

2. **Documentation Tasks**
   - [ ] Add API endpoint examples
   - [ ] Create testing documentation
   - [ ] Document deployment procedures
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting guides

3. **Review & Validation**
   - [ ] Technical review of architecture
   - [ ] Security audit of proposed structure
   - [ ] Performance review of data flows
   - [ ] Validation of type safety approach

## Notes & Decisions

1. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Using Next.js 14 App Router for API routes
   - Implementing strict type safety with TypeScript and Zod
   - Adopting a service-layer pattern for business logic
   - Using Supabase for database and authentication

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Implemented caching strategy for API responses
   - Added database optimization guidelines
   - Documented AI optimization approaches

3. **Security Measures**
   - Documented authentication flow
   - Added row-level security patterns
   - Included API security measures

## Questions & Concerns

1. Need to validate:
   - Database schema optimization
   - Cache invalidation strategies
   - Error handling patterns
   - Testing approach

2. Open discussions:
   - Deployment environment setup
   - Monitoring tool selection
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration
   - Database backup strategy
