  Action: "Start Building Better Today"
  ```

### FAB (Features-Advantages-Benefits)

  Features: ["Voice-First Input", "Photo-to-Document", "Unified Platform"]
  Advantages: ["Save Time", "Reduce Errors", "Eliminate Tool Overload"]
  Benefits: ["Cut Costs", "Faster Project Completion", "Happier Teams"]
  ```

### BAB (Before-After-Bridge)

- **Key Points:** Delivers impact through clear before/after contrast and bridges to solutions effectively
- **Implementation Example:**

  ```jsx
  Before: "40% of your week lost to admin tasks"

  Bridge: "Voice-first AI that lets you build more, type less"
  ```

### ACC (Awareness-Comprehension-Conviction)

  ```

### 5Ps (Promise-Picture-Proof-Push-Polite)

  Proof: "Real builders saving real time"
  Push: "Start saving time today"
  Polite: "Your legacy awaits"
  ```

## Frameworks Better Suited for Other Content

### PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

- **Best For:** Short, punchy copy
- **Note:** May be too brief for conversion-focused pages seeking sign-ups

### QUEST (Qualify-Understand-Educate-Stimulate-Transition)

- **Best For:** Longer educational content and blog posts
- **Note:** Better suited for educational content than quick-conversion landing pages

### STAR (Situation-Task-Action-Result)

- **Best For:** Case studies and success stories
- **Note:** Works best in dedicated "Success Stories" sections

### 3x3 (Three Groups of Three)

- **Best For:** Detailed content like white papers
- **Note:** More suitable for structured documentation than landing pages

### SOAP (Situation-Objective-Action-Plan)

- **Best For:** Planning documents and strategy sessions
- **Note:** Methodical approach better suits planning documents than direct-response landing pages
