4. Database schema design and optimization
5. API security and rate limiting
6. Performance optimization and caching strategies
7. Background task management
8. Error handling and logging
9. Testing (unit tests and integration tests)

## Current Tasks and Priorities

1. Implement role-based access control system
2. Enhance session management
3. Optimize Firebase security rules
4. Set up logging system
5. Implement API caching strategies
6. Create user profile management endpoints
7. Optimize database queries
8. Implement rate limiting
9. Set up monitoring for backend services
10. Create API documentation

## Security Implementation

1. Implement comprehensive authentication checks
2. Set up session management
3. Create audit logging system
4. Implement API security measures
5. Set up data validation

## Development Environment Setup

1. Use Python virtual environments for isolated dependency management:

   ```python
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:

   ```python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up pre-commit hooks for code formatting and linting:

   ```python
   pre-commit install
   ```

## API Documentation Guidelines

1. Use FastAPI's built-in support for OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation.
2. Document all API endpoints using docstrings and FastAPI's `response_model` parameter.
3. Include example requests and responses in the documentation.
4. Use clear and concise descriptions for all parameters and response fields.

Example of a well-documented endpoint:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

router = APIRouter()

class SurveyResponse(BaseModel):
    question_id: int
    answer: str

class SurveyResult(BaseModel):
    score: int
    recommendation: str

@router.post("/survey/submit", response_model=SurveyResult)
async def submit_survey(
    responses: list[SurveyResponse],
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """
    Submit AI Readiness Survey responses and get results.

    - **responses**: List of survey responses
    - **current_user**: Authenticated user (injected by dependency)

    Returns a SurveyResult with score and recommendation.
    """
    # Implementation details...
    return SurveyResult(score=75, recommendation="Your company is ready for AI adoption.")
```

## Error Handling and Logging

1. Use custom exception classes for different types of errors:

```python
class NotFoundError(HTTPException):
    def __init__(self, detail: str):
        super().__init__(status_code=404, detail=detail)

class ValidationError(HTTPException):
    def __init__(self, detail: str):
        super().__init__(status_code=400, detail=detail)
```

2. Implement a centralized error handler:

```python
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

@app.exception_handler(HTTPException)
async def http_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: HTTPException):
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=exc.status_code,
        content={"message": exc.detail},
    )
```

3. Use structured logging for better searchability and analysis:

```python
import logging
import json

def log_info(message: str, extra: dict = None):
    logging.info(json.dumps({"message": message, "extra": extra or {}}))

# Usage
log_info("User completed survey", {"user_id": user.id, "survey_id": survey.id})
```

## Database Management

1. Use SQLAlchemy for database operations and Alembic for migrations.
2. Create a new migration:

   ```python
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of the change"
   ```

3. Apply migrations:

   ```python
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

## Background Tasks

Use FastAPI's background tasks for short-running operations:

```python
from fastapi import BackgroundTasks

@router.post("/send-report")
async def send_report(email: str, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    background_tasks.add_task(generate_and_send_report, email)
    return {"message": "Report generation started"}

async def generate_and_send_report(email: str):
    # Implementation details...
    pass
```

For long-running tasks, consider using Celery or other task queue systems.

## API Versioning

Implement API versioning using path prefixes:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

v1_router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v1")
v2_router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v2")

@v1_router.get("/users")
async def get_users_v1():
    # V1 implementation

@v2_router.get("/users")
async def get_users_v2():
    # V2 implementation

app.include_router(v1_router)
app.include_router(v2_router)
```

## Firebase Best Practices

1. Use Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations.
2. Structure Firestore data for efficient querying:
   - Denormalize data when necessary to reduce the number of reads.
   - Use subcollections for one-to-many relationships.
3. Implement security rules to restrict data access.
4. Use batch writes for multiple document updates.

Example of efficient Firestore querying:

```python
from firebase_admin import firestore

db = firestore.client()

def get_user_projects(user_id: str):
    return db.collection('projects').where('user_id', '==', user_id).get()

def batch_update_project_status(project_ids: list[str], new_status: str):
    batch = db.batch()
    for project_id in project_ids:
        project_ref = db.collection('projects').document(project_id)
        batch.update(project_ref, {'status': new_status})
    batch.commit()
```

When working on these tasks, always consider the impact on performance, security, and scalability. Collaborate closely with frontend developers and AI/ML engineers to ensure cohesive development of the Constructiv AI platform.
