        always {
            junit 'test-results/**/*.xml'
        }
    }
}
```

## Multi-Environment Setup

Implement a multi-environment setup using Terraform workspaces:

```hcl
# Create workspaces for different environments
resource "terraform_workspace" "environment" {
  name = var.environment
}

# Use workspace-specific variables
locals {
  env_config = {
    dev = {
      instance_type = "t3.micro"
      min_size      = 1
      max_size      = 3
    }
    staging = {
      instance_type = "t3.small"
      min_size      = 2
      max_size      = 5
    }
    prod = {
      instance_type = "t3.medium"
      min_size      = 3
      max_size      = 10
    }
  }
}

# Use the configuration in resources
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  instance_type = local.env_config[terraform.workspace].instance_type
  # ... other configuration
}
```

## Container Registry Management

Set up and manage an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR):

```hcl
resource "aws_ecr_repository" "constructiv_ai" {
  name                 = "constructiv-ai"
  image_tag_mutability = "MUTABLE"

  image_scanning_configuration {
    scan_on_push = true
  }
}

# Add lifecycle policy to manage image retention
resource "aws_ecr_lifecycle_policy" "constructiv_ai_policy" {
  repository = aws_ecr_repository.constructiv_ai.name

  policy = jsonencode({
    rules = [{
      rulePriority = 1
      description  = "Keep last 10 images"
      selection = {
        tagStatus     = "any"
        countType     = "imageCountMoreThan"
        countNumber   = 10
      }
      action = {
        type = "expire"
      }
    }]
  })
}
```

## SSL/TLS Certificate Management

Implement SSL/TLS certificate management using AWS Certificate Manager:

```hcl
resource "aws_acm_certificate" "constructiv_ai" {
  domain_name       = "constructiv-ai.com"
  validation_method = "DNS"

  subject_alternative_names = [
    "www.constructiv-ai.com",
    "api.constructiv-ai.com"
  ]

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

# Validate the certificate
resource "aws_route53_record" "cert_validation" {
  for_each = {
    for dvo in aws_acm_certificate.constructiv_ai.domain_validation_options : dvo.domain_name => {
      name   = dvo.resource_record_name
      record = dvo.resource_record_value
      type   = dvo.resource_record_type
    }
  }

  allow_overwrite = true
  name            = each.value.name
  records         = [each.value.record]
  ttl             = 60
  type            = each.value.type
  zone_id         = aws_route53_zone.primary.zone_id
}

# Wait for certificate validation
resource "aws_acm_certificate_validation" "cert" {
  certificate_arn         = aws_acm_certificate.constructiv_ai.arn
  validation_record_fqdns = [for record in aws_route53_record.cert_validation : record.fqdn]
}
```

## Content Delivery Network (CDN) Setup

Set up Amazon CloudFront as a CDN for static assets:

```hcl
resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "constructiv_ai_cdn" {
  origin {
    domain_name = aws_s3_bucket.static_assets.bucket_regional_domain_name
    origin_id   = "S3-static-assets"

    s3_origin_config {
      origin_access_identity = aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identity.oai.cloudfront_access_identity_path
    }
  }

  enabled             = true
  is_ipv6_enabled     = true
  default_root_object = "index.html"

  default_cache_behavior {
    allowed_methods  = ["GET", "HEAD", "OPTIONS"]
    cached_methods   = ["GET", "HEAD"]
    target_origin_id = "S3-static-assets"

    forwarded_values {
      query_string = false
      cookies {
        forward = "none"
      }
    }

    viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https"
    min_ttl                = 0
    default_ttl            = 3600
    max_ttl                = 86400
  }

  price_class = "PriceClass_100"

  restrictions {
    geo_restriction {
      restriction_type = "none"
    }
  }

  viewer_certificate {
    acm_certificate_arn = aws_acm_certificate.constructiv_ai.arn
    ssl_support_method  = "sni-only"
  }

  tags = {
    Environment = terraform.workspace
  }
}
```
