# Implementation Plan for Constructiv AI Platform

## Project Understanding

Constructiv AI is developing an AI-powered platform for the construction industry, focused on streamlining workflows and increasing efficiency for small to midsize construction businesses. The platform aims to simplify complex construction processes through technology, making them more accessible and manageable.

Key objectives of the platform include:

- Digitizing and automating construction workflows
- Providing AI-assisted project management tools
- Offering document management and collaboration features
- Enabling real-time communication between stakeholders
- Integrating with existing construction software and tools
- Providing data-driven insights for decision making

## Current Project Rules

1. **Code Documentation Rule**: All code must be properly documented using standardized docstrings that include:
   - One-line summary
   - Detailed description
   - Parameter descriptions
   - Return value descriptions
   - Usage examples
   - Links to detailed documentation

2. **Markdown Documentation Rule**: All markdown files must:
   - Follow best practices for markdown formatting
   - Include clear, logically ordered task lists
   - Provide concise summaries of key concepts
   - Explain code examples thoroughly
   - Avoid repetitive headings

3. **Coding Principles**:
   - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Focus on straightforward, readable solutions
   - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Implement only currently needed features
   - SOLID Principles: Follow software design principles for maintainable code

## Development Approach

### AI-Assisted Development Model

This project will utilize an AI-assisted development model where:

- Claude (AI assistant) will handle the actual coding implementation
- Human oversight will provide direction, review, and approval
- Development will occur in focused sessions rather than continuous work

### GitHub Workflow and Branch Management

We will implement a structured GitHub workflow to manage the development process:

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Initialize repository with main/master branch
   - Create a development branch as the primary integration branch
   - Protect main branch with pull request requirements

2. **Feature Branch Workflow**
   - Each feature will be developed in a dedicated feature branch
   - Branch naming convention: `feature/feature-name`
   - Bug fixes will use: `fix/bug-description`
   - Enhancements will use: `enhance/enhancement-description`

3. **Branch Lifecycle**
   - Create feature branch from development branch
   - Implement and test feature in isolation
   - Create pull request to merge into development
   - Review, approve, and merge
   - Delete feature branch after successful merge
   - Periodically merge stable development into main

4. **Release Process**
   - Create release branch from development: `release/v1.x.x`
   - Perform final testing and bug fixes on release branch
   - Merge to main and tag with version number
   - Merge changes back to development

### Development Sessions Structure

Development will occur in focused sessions rather than continuous work:

1. **Planning Session**
   - Review requirements and objectives
   - Define scope of current feature/task
   - Create GitHub issues for tracking
   - Set up feature branch

2. **Implementation Session**
   - AI implements code based on requirements
   - Human provides feedback and direction
   - Commit changes incrementally with descriptive messages
   - Document progress and decisions

3. **Review Session**
   - Review implemented code
   - Run tests and verify functionality
   - Address any issues or improvements
   - Prepare for pull request

4. **Integration Session**
   - Create pull request
   - Review changes at a higher level
   - Merge to development branch
   - Plan next feature implementation
