# **Constructiv AI – Task & Project Management Strategy**

## `Task_Management_Strategy.md`

```markdown

This document details how to organize development tasks efficiently—leveraging GitHub Projects (or similar tools) and agile methodologies (Kanban/Scrum) to ensure on-time delivery of the Constructiv AI “Max” platform.

---

## 1. Task Breakdown

- **Decompose by Feature**: Each major feature (e.g., Daily Log AI, OCR, Vector Search) should be split into actionable tasks:
  - Example: “Implement voice file upload route” vs. “Integrate Whisper transcription results.”
- **Identify Dependencies**: For instance, AI tasks (embedding or OCR) depend on environment config (OpenAI keys, Tesseract installation).
- **Assign Ownership**: Each task is owned by either a real developer or an AI Agent role (FE, BE, AI, QA).

## 2. GitHub Projects & Kanban Workflow

### 2.1 Kanban Columns

1. **To Do**  
   - Tasks ready to be picked up.
2. **In Progress**  
   - Tasks actively in development by an assigned Agent.
3. **Review**  
   - Tasks requiring peer review, QA validation, or stakeholder sign-off.
4. **Done**  
   - Completed tasks meeting acceptance criteria.

### 2.2 Recommended GitHub Setup

1. **Automated Kanban**  
   - Use GitHub’s built-in automation so that when a Pull Request is merged, the card moves automatically to “Done.”
2. **Pull Requests & Issues Extension**  
   - Install GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension in VS Code to link commits/PRs to tasks.
3. **Task Templates**  
   - Create issue templates for standard tasks, e.g., “AI Feature Implementation,” “Bug Fix,” “UI Enhancement.”
4. **Linking Commits**  
   - Reference issue IDs in commit messages (e.g., “Fix #25”) for automatic project updates.

## 3. Scrum & Sprint Planning

Although Kanban can be continuous, you may also adopt a Scrum-like sprint cycle (1-2 weeks):

1. **Function-Based Sprints**  
   - Focus on a specific module or functionality each sprint (e.g., “This sprint: Complete voice transcription pipeline”).
2. **Sprint Ceremonies**  
   - *Sprint Planning*: Determine tasks that fit into the next iteration.  
   - *Daily Standups*: Short sync (live or async) to address blockers.  
   - *Sprint Review*: Demonstrate completed features to stakeholders.  
   - *Sprint Retrospective*: Evaluate what went well and what can improve.

## 4. Prioritization Framework

1. **MoSCoW**  
   - **Must-Have**: Core tasks critical to MVP viability (e.g., Supabase config, AI daily log).  
   - **Should-Have**: Important but not blocking MVP release (e.g., advanced real-time presence).  
   - **Could-Have**: Nice to have features or enhancements (e.g., theming, advanced analytics).  
   - **Won’t-Have**: Explicitly out of scope for this release (e.g., deep accounting integrations).
2. **Eisenhower Matrix**  
   - Focus on tasks that are **Important** and **Urgent** first, such as user-facing blockers or security patches.

## 5. Recommended Workflow

1. **Create/Refine Tasks**  
   - Break high-level feature requests into smaller tasks.  
   - Use standardized templates with acceptance criteria (e.g., “Given a voice file is uploaded, then a transcript is returned in JSON”).
2. **Assign & Estimate**  
   - Each task is assigned to an Agent with an estimated complexity or hours.  
   - Mark tasks “M” or “L” if exact hours are unknown (e.g., T-shirt sizing).
3. **Visual Tracking**  
   - Move tasks across Kanban columns as progress is made.  
   - Keep tasks small enough to complete in 1-2 days to maintain momentum.
4. **Automated CI/CD**  
   - On each commit or pull request, run tests.  
   - If tests pass, tasks can be moved to “Review.”
5. **Deploy & Demo**  
   - Deploy to staging or feature branch on Vercel.  
   - QA or stakeholders test and provide feedback.
6. **Close & Document**  
   - Once accepted, tasks move to “Done.”  
   - Document any relevant wiki pages or READMEs for future reference.

## 6. Example Task Flow

1. **[In Progress → Review]**: Developer/Agent finishes the front-end form for voice upload. Opens PR #42 referencing “Voice Upload Form (#12).”  
2. **[Review → Done]**: QA or PM reviews PR #42; merges if it meets acceptance. GitHub’s Kanban board automatically updates status to “Done.”

---

## 7. Continuous Improvement

- **Retrospectives**: After each sprint or milestone, gather the team to discuss what can be improved in the task management flow.  
- **Backlog Grooming**: Periodically refine tasks, reorder priorities, and clarify acceptance criteria to keep the backlog healthy.  
- **Automation**: Explore additional GitHub Actions to label tasks, trigger test suites, or auto-assign reviewers to lighten administrative load.

By following these agile-inspired practices—task breakdown, Kanban or Scrum board usage, and robust prioritization—you’ll maintain a clear, efficient development workflow. This approach ensures the Constructiv AI “Max” platform evolves predictably, meeting deadlines while incorporating continuous feedback.
