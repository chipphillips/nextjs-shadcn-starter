   - *Resolution*: Implement magic links for MVP, document OAuth as future enhancement

2. **AI Integration**
   - *Conflict*: Specific AI provider requirements vs. provider-agnostic approach
   - *Resolution*: Use OpenAI for MVP with abstracted AI layer for future provider flexibility

3. **Offline Capabilities**
   - *Conflict*: Priority level discrepancy between documents
   - *Resolution*: Implement as core feature for MVP based on user stories

4. **Document Management**
   - *Conflict*: Varying retention requirements
   - *Resolution*: Implement 30-day minimum with configurable extension
