# Constructiv AI Feature Roadmap

## Project Description

Constructiv AI is building an intuitive AI-powered construction management platform designed specifically for small to midsize builders. The platform's centerpiece is **Max**, an AI assistant that understands voice input and helps eliminate manual, time-consuming administrative burdens of running a construction business.

The platform serves as a single source of truth for all construction-related activities, reducing the need for multiple disconnected tools.
